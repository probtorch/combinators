#+TITLE: Development

* Nix and python
To get access to the binary cache, use: `cachix use combinators`.

To access the development shell, a flake is provided which can be accessed via
`nix develop`. You can, experimentally access this without nix via pip (see
[https://github.com/numtide/devshell](`devshell`)), but this is not tested.
